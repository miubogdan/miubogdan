With a background in retail industry, I thrive on exploring complex datasets and developing innovative solutions to solve business challenges.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Pizza Database with SQL](https://github.com/miubogdan/PizzaSQLProject)
This project contains a collection of SQL queries designed to demonstrate my expertise in SQL programming and database management. The queries are crafted to address a variety of real-world data manipulation and analysis scenarios, showcasing the ability to handle data structures and produce meaningful insights.

### Project 2: [Bike Rides Analysis with Python and Tableau](https://github.com/miubogdan/Bike-Rides-Analysis/tree/main)
In this project I programmatically gather the data, explore and manipulate it using Python pandas library and then I create impactful interactive visualizations in Tableau, including total bike rides, moving average, temperature vs windspeed heatmap, rides split by weather and hour.

### Project 3: [Crime Analysis with Python](https://github.com/miubogdan/crime-analysis/tree/main)
I’m using a large dataset with over 300k rows and 17 columns containing crimes that occurred in Boston between 2015 and 2018. I use the numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries to read, explore and respond to some questions at the end of the notebook, using charts and heatmaps. 

### Project 4: [British Airways Reviews Analysis with Tableau](https://github.com/miubogdan/ba-reviews/tree/main)
This project addresses British Airways' challenge in understanding customer satisfaction from extensive data. It develops a solution to analyze and extract meaningful insights, enabling the airline to make informed decisions for service enhancement.

### Project 5: [Interactive dashboard and pivot tables in Excel](https://github.com/miubogdan/CoffeeOrders/tree/main)
In this project I’m gathering the data, transform it then use pivot tables and pivot charts to build a dynamic interactive coffee sales dashboard. The dashboard includes line chart with total sales over time by the type of coffee, option to filter data by period/size/card/roast type, sales by country and top 5 customers. 

### Project 6: [A simple Wikipedia scraper with Python](https://github.com/miubogdan/WikiScraper1)
A simple web scraper that accesses the FTSE 100 index Wikipedia page, searches for the Constituents table, then goes to each company page to gather the company information then writes in in a CSV.
